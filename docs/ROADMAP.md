## Phase 4 — Database Models
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Create `users` table migration (already exists via Laravel default)
- Create `analyses` table migration (MySQL-compatible):
  - `id`, `user_id`, `code` (text), `language`, `time_complexity`, `space_complexity`, `explanation`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Create `Analysis` Eloquent model
- Define relationships: `User hasMany Analysis`
- Write model factories and seeders for testing

**Deliverables:**
- Migrations run successfully
- Models and relationships defined
- Factories written

---

## Phase 5 — Basic Analysis API
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Create `POST /api/analyses` endpoint (submit code for analysis)
- Create `GET /api/analyses` endpoint (list user's history)
- Create `GET /api/analyses/{id}` endpoint (get single analysis)
- Add request validation (code length, format)
- Return stubbed/placeholder complexity results initially
- Write API tests for each endpoint

**Deliverables:**
- Analysis CRUD endpoints working
- Validation in place
- API tests passing

---

## Phase 6 — Complexity Analyser
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Implement `ComplexityEstimatorService` in Laravel
- Use PHP regex/string analysis to detect common patterns:
  - Single loops → O(n)
  - Nested loops → O(n²)
  - Recursive patterns → O(log n) or O(n log n)
  - No loops → O(1)
- Estimate space complexity from variable/array declarations
- Integrate service into analysis endpoint
- Write unit tests for the service

**Deliverables:**
- `ComplexityEstimatorService` with unit tests
- Analysis endpoint returns real estimates

---

## Phase 7 — Frontend Editor & Results
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Build the main editor page in React
- Wire up Monaco Editor to submit code via API
- Display complexity results in a clean results panel
- Add loading states and error handling
- Style the results with complexity badges (O(n), O(n²), etc.)

**Deliverables:**
- Editor → Submit → Results flow working end to end

---

## Phase 8 — Analysis History
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Build history list page in React
- Fetch and paginate `GET /api/analyses`
- Allow clicking a history item to reload code + results
- Add delete functionality (`DELETE /api/analyses/{id}`)
- Display timestamps, complexity summary in history list

**Deliverables:**
- History page with pagination
- Delete working
- Full history flow tested

---

## Phase 9 — Execution Visualizer
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Design execution trace data structure
- Implement `ExecutionTracerService` (static trace simulation, no actual execution)
- Build step-by-step visualizer UI in React
- Animate variable state changes, loop iterations, call stack
- Integrate with analysis results display

**Deliverables:**
- Step visualizer working for common patterns (loops, conditionals)

---

## Phase 10 — Queue Processing
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Install and configure Redis
- Configure Laravel Queue with Redis driver
- Move analysis processing into a queued Job (`AnalyseCodeJob`)
- Install and configure Laravel Horizon for queue monitoring
- Return a pending status immediately; poll or use WebSocket for completion
- Handle failed jobs gracefully

**Deliverables:**
- Async analysis via Redis queue
- Horizon dashboard operational

---

## Phase 11 — AI Explanations
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Integrate OpenAI API (or similar) for natural-language code explanation
- Create `AiExplainerService` in Laravel
- Send sanitized code (not executed) to AI for explanation
- Cache AI responses to reduce API cost
- Add AI explanation to analysis result display

**Deliverables:**
- AI explanations appearing in results
- Caching layer in place

---

## Phase 12 — Node.js Analysis Microservice
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Initialize Node.js service in `services/analyser/`
- Use Babel/Acorn to parse JavaScript into AST
- Implement AST-based complexity detection (more accurate than regex)
- Expose REST endpoint for Laravel to call
- Integrate via Laravel HTTP client + queue job
- Write tests for the Node.js service

**Deliverables:**
- Node.js service running independently
- Laravel delegates analysis jobs to it
- AST-based complexity results

---

## Phase 13 — Testing
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Write comprehensive unit tests for all Services
- Write feature tests for all API endpoints
- Write frontend component tests (React Testing Library)
- Set up CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Ensure all tests pass before any deployment

**Deliverables:**
- Full test suite with >80% coverage target
- CI pipeline passing

---

## Phase 14 — Docker Deployment
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- Write `Dockerfile` for Laravel backend
- Write `Dockerfile` for React frontend (served via Nginx)
- Write `Dockerfile` for Node.js analysis service
- Write `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- Write `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production
- Document deployment steps

**Deliverables:**

- Production compose file ready

---

## Phase 15 — Production Hardening
**Status:** ⬜ Not Started
